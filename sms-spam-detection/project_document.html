            <h2>3. Project Overview</h2>
            <p><strong>Background / Motivation:</strong><br>Spam detection is a critical task in modern telecommunications. Unsolicited and often malicious SMS messages, known as spam, negatively impact user experience, can lead to financial fraud, and pose significant security risks. An effective automated system to filter these messages is essential for protecting users and maintaining the integrity of mobile communication services.</p>
            <p><strong>Scope:</strong><br>This project will focus exclusively on the classification of English-language SMS messages into two binary categories: "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). The project will not handle multimedia messages (MMS), messages in other languages, or real-time message interception from a mobile network. The solution will be a standalone model and inference pipeline.</p>
            <p><strong>High-level Description:</strong><br>The project aims to build a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying SMS messages. The system will be developed as a complete pipeline, starting from raw text data, undergoing preprocessing and feature extraction, and finally being fed into a trained classification model to produce a prediction. A simple command-line interface (CLI) will be developed for user interaction.</p>
            <p><strong>Dataset / Data Source Summary:</strong><br>The project will utilize the publicly available "SMS Spam Collection Data Set" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains 5,574 SMS messages tagged as either "ham" or "spam", providing a substantial foundation for training and evaluating the model.</p>

            <h2>4. Objectives & Problem Statement</h2>
            <h3>4.1 Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>The core problem to be solved is the binary classification of SMS messages. Given the raw text content of an SMS message, the system must accurately predict whether it belongs to the "spam" or "ham" class. Key challenges include the short and informal nature of SMS text, which often contains slang, abbreviations, and typos, as well as the inherent class imbalance typically found in spam datasets (where "ham" messages are more frequent).</p>
            <h3>4.2 Objectives</h3>
            <p>The specific goals for this project are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To build a predictive machine learning model that achieves high precision and recall for the "spam" class, minimizing both false positives and false negatives.</li>
                <li>To experiment with and compare the performance of at least two different machine learning algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression).</li>
                <li>To develop and implement an effective text preprocessing pipeline to clean and normalize SMS data.</li>
                <li>To create a functional inference pipeline that can classify new, unseen SMS messages.</li>
                <li>To rigorously evaluate and compare model performance using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix.</li>
                <li>To document the entire process, findings, and suggest potential areas for improvement.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Proposed Solution</h2>
            <p><strong>Approach / Methodology:</strong><br>The project will employ a supervised learning approach. The text data will be converted into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). Several classification algorithms will be implemented and compared, starting with Naive Bayes as a strong baseline, followed by Logistic Regression for comparison.</p>
            <p><strong>Pipeline Overview:</strong><br>The system will follow a clear, sequential pipeline:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Raw SMS Input:</strong> The system accepts a raw text string.</li>
                <li><strong>Preprocessing:</strong> The text is cleaned (lowercasing, punctuation removal), tokenized, and stripped of stopwords.</li>
                <li><strong>Feature Extraction:</strong> The cleaned text is transformed into a numerical vector using a pre-fitted TF-IDF Vectorizer.</li>
                <li><strong>Model Prediction:</strong> The numerical vector is fed into the trained classification model.</li>
                <li><strong>Prediction Output:</strong> The model outputs a prediction ("spam" or "ham") along with a confidence score.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Justification of Choices:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Preprocessing:</strong> Lowercasing and removing punctuation standardizes the text. Stopword removal helps the model focus on meaningful words.</li>
                <li><strong>Feature Extraction (TF-IDF):</strong> TF-IDF is chosen over a simple bag-of-words (CountVectorizer) because it weighs words by their importance, giving higher scores to words that are frequent in a message but rare across all messages, which is often indicative of spam.</li>
                <li><strong>Models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression):</strong> Naive Bayes is a classic, fast, and effective algorithm for text classification. Logistic Regression is a robust, linear model that provides good performance and interpretability, making it an excellent candidate for comparison.</li>

            <h2>9. Implementation Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Data Acquisition / Loading:</strong> Loaded the "SMS Spam Collection Data Set" from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.</li>
                <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong> Analyzed the distribution of "spam" vs. "ham" messages to understand class imbalance. Examined message length statistics for both classes.</li>
                <li><strong>Text Preprocessing:</strong> Defined a function to perform the following: convert text to lowercase, remove punctuation and special characters using regex, tokenize the text, and remove English stopwords using the NLTK library.</li>
                <li><strong>Feature Extraction:</strong> Initialized and applied <code>TfidfVectorizer</code> from scikit-learn to the preprocessed text data to convert it into a numerical matrix.</li>
                <li><strong>Train-Test Split:</strong> Split the feature matrix and labels into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using <code>train_test_split</code>.</li>
                <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> Trained a <code>MultinomialNB</code> model as the baseline. Trained a <code>LogisticRegression</code> model for comparison.</li>
                <li><strong>Hyperparameter Tuning:</strong> Used <code>GridSearchCV</code> to tune the <code>C</code> parameter for the Logistic Regression model to find the optimal balance between bias and variance.</li>
                <li><strong>Model Evaluation:</strong> Evaluated both models on the test set. Generated a classification report (precision, recall, F1-score) and a confusion matrix for each. The Logistic Regression model showed superior performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Error Analysis:</strong> Manually reviewed several misclassified messages from the test set to identify common patterns or failure cases (e.g., very short, ambiguous messages).</li>
                <li><strong>Save Model + Vectorizer:</strong> Used <code>joblib.dump</code> to save the final, tuned Logistic Regression model and the fitted TfidfVectorizer to disk for later use in inference.</li>
                <li><strong>Build Inference Module / Script:</strong> Created a Python script (<code>predict.py</code>) that loads the saved model and vectorizer, takes a message as a command-line argument, processes it, and outputs the prediction.</li>
                <li><strong>Testing on New Unseen Messages:</strong> Tested the inference script with a variety of custom-written spam and ham messages to verify its real-world performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Documentation and Reporting:</strong> Compiled all findings, code, and results into this final project document.</li>

            <h2>13. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This project successfully addressed the problem of SMS spam classification by building a robust machine learning pipeline. We started with a clear problem statement and set of objectives, which guided the implementation. The proposed solution, utilizing TF-IDF feature extraction and a Logistic Regression classifier, proved to be highly effective, achieving over 98% accuracy on the test set.</p>
            <p>The key to success was effective text preprocessing and the choice of a powerful yet interpretable model. The main challenge faced was the inherent class imbalance, which was managed by focusing on precision and recall metrics for the minority "spam" class. A limitation of the current system is its restriction to English text and its reliance on classical machine learning methods.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, the project demonstrates a practical and effective solution to SMS spam detection. The next steps would be to implement the future enhancements, particularly exploring deep learning models and deploying the system as an API to broaden its utility.</p>
